* Adds the database name, mySQL username, and mySQL password to an environment variable file
* Is able to connect to a database using Sequelize, when entering schema and seed commands:
    - A database is created and is seeded with test data
* Enters the command to invoke the application:
    - The server starts, and Sequelize models synch to mySQL database
* Opens the API GET routes in Insomnia Core for:
    - Categories
    - Products or
    - Tags
    the data for each route is displayed in JSON format

* Tests API: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, the user can successfully create, update, and delete data in the database
